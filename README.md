## Introduction to Physics in Three.js
Physics is the natural science that studies matter, its fundamental constituents, its motion and behavior through space and time, and the related entities of energy and force.

Physics is always important in 3D graphics. It makes scenes more realistic. If you simply put your object into the scene, it will move nicely and realistically. So you spend less time tuning each move.

There are some Physics Laws that can be used in 3D Graphics to make it simply stunning. Those are :
- Lighting
- Torque
- Rotation
- Collision
- Linear Movement
- Friction (Gravitational or Linear)
- And many more!

Some games and movies even implement this in the making of 3D Graphics. Especially nowadays, a game/movie will be less interesting and spectacular without 3D Graphics. Let’s say
Games like Grand Theft Auto V, Black Myth, Red Dead Redemption and God Of War.

Those games will implement dozens of Physical Laws to make a stunning view and/or effects. Let’s say in Grand Theft Auto V, the cars have a break and gas to stop and move which implements the Physics Law of Linear Movement.

Whilst, some game modes purposely don’t obey the law of Physics like Creative Mode in Minecraft where the player can fly or create a block way high above the sky or in the sea without the block falling. It was all made to have some fun that we can’t have in the real world. Without further ado, let’s dive into some of it in three.js.
