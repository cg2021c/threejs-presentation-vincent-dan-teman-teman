## Introduction to Ammo.js
### What is Ammo.js ðŸ¤”
Ammo.js is one of the most powerful JavaScript Physics Engine available, created to help the user create two dimensional Physics Simulation to an object.
- Ammo.js has an interesting pedigree as it actually is a direct JavaScript port of *Bullet3D*.

- *Bullet3D* itself is a powerful open source C++ based Physics Engine which has been used in video games and also movies.

- **Ammo** actually stands for "Avoided Making My Own js physics engine by compiling BulletJs from C++". (No Jokes, try searching for it)

- The creator of Ammo.js is never stated, but the code can be found in the [Github Repository](https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js) created by an user **kripken** with 40+ Authors which contribute in the creation of this engine.

## Terms in Ammo.js
### Physical World
There has to be a world that obeys the laws of physics except that in a parallel Universe that has its own set of Physical Laws.
- The definition of Physical World simply means the world where the physics simulation will take place in.

- In Ammo.js this world is called a Collision World and has among its derivatives the Dynamic World.

- This physics world has options to set gravity and expose functions and objects so it can create a physics simulation within an objects.
