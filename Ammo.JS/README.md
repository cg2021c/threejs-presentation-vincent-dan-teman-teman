## Introduction to Ammo.js
### What is Ammo.js ü§î
Ammo.js is one of the most powerful JavaScript Physics Engine available, created to help the user create two dimensional Physics Simulation to an object.
- Ammo.js has an interesting pedigree as it actually is a direct JavaScript port of *Bullet3D*.

- *Bullet3D* itself is a powerful open source C++ based Physics Engine which has been used in video games and also movies.

- **Ammo** actually stands for "Avoided Making My Own js physics engine by compiling BulletJs from C++". (No Jokes, try searching for it)

- The creator of Ammo.js is never stated, but the code can be found in the [Github Repository](https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js) created by an user **kripken** with 40+ Authors which contribute in the creation of this engine.

## Terms in Ammo.js
### Physical World üåç

There has to be a world that obeys the laws of physics except that in a parallel Universe that has its own set of Physical Laws.
- The definition of Physical World simply means the world where the physics simulation will take place in.

- In Ammo.js this world is called a Collision World and has among its derivatives the Dynamic World.

- This physics world has options to set gravity and expose functions and objects so it can create a physics simulation within an objects.

### Rigid Body 

Physics is a study about matters, in which there has to be a body alongside with the mass, density, etc.  

- In ammo.js this body is called a **Collision Object** or a **Rigid Body** which moves, collides, has a mass and has an impulse applied to it.

- Rigid Body is idealised representation of a body in which deformation is ignored. This means that a shape which doesn't change, and can be manipulated via certain properties.

- The default rigid body is formless and it needed a shape to interact in Physical Simulation and calculate the *Inertia Tensor*.

Examples of **Rigid Body** 
* Position and orientation

* Linear velocity

* Angular velocity

* Forces and impulses

* Torques and torque impulses

### Types of Rigid Body

#### Rigid Body : Dynamic
Dynamic rigid bodies have mass greater than zero and will move around being affected by the forces and laws governing the physics world. The object will be affected by gravity, impulse, and would respond appropriately to collisions from other bodies.

Examples :
- Billiard/Snooker Game 
- FPS Shooting Game

#### Rigid Body : Static
Static rigid bodies are just what their name says which is static and can never be moved by the user. The requirements to be a static rigid body is having the mass of 0.

Examples :
- The Billiard Table
- The Ground

#### Rigid Body : Kinematic
Kinematic objects are static objects that can be moved by the user. The object will not be affected by any force from the physics world not even gravity, they are just there.

Example :
- A Floating Block in Minecraft
