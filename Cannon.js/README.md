# About Cannon.js

## Lightweight 3D physics for the web
Inspired by three.js and ammo.js, and driven by the fact that the web lacks a physics engine, here comes cannon.js. The rigid body physics engine includes simple collision detection, various body shapes, contacts, friction and constraints.

## Features
- Lightweight, smaller file size than many ported physics engines.
- 100% open source JavaScript, written from scratch.
- Uses an iterative Gauss-Seidel solver to solve constraints.
- Uses the SPOOK stepper.
